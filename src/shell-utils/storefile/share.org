* as a software component

  the server will be read only, if it finds that a file is corrupt then it will record that in a list but not touch the file
  when it starts up it will search the directories it is given for files and assume that their filename is their digest
  
* commands that the sharing server accepts:

  - digest a given part of the file

    arguments are: file digest, offset, size

  - send a given part of the file

    arguments are: file digest, offset, size

  - check a digest that a peer thinks is wrong

    arguments are: file digest

* downloading procedure

  1) find peers who have the file you want
  2) request chunks of the file from peers (you can choose the size/position of the chunks arbitrarily)
  3) once the transfer is completed, checksum the file with the digest you expect
     - if it matches, then you are done
     - if not, then go through the peers hosting the file and download the different blocks they advertise.
       Try the differences on a per peer basis until you either match the digest or run out of peers.
